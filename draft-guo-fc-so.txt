               A Profile for Forwarding Commitments (FCs)
                         draft-guo-fc-so-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Forwarding Commitment
   (FC) used in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  An FC is a
   digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP
   address prefix is announced from AS a to AS b.  When validated, an
   FC's eContent can be used for the detection and mitigation of route
   hijacking and provide protection for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-
   UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plagues Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security.  (See [RFC6480] for more
   information.)  As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow
   entities to verify that an AS has been given permission by an IP
   address holder to advertise a route along the propagation path.  An
   FC provides this function.

   Forwarding Commitment (FC) is a signed object that binds the IP
   prefix with AS and its next hops, eventually, it could compose and
   protect the path of BGP-UPDATE propagation.  It uses a Web of Trust
   in this propagation model.  That means It performs more like that
   originator AS trusts its next hop ASes and sends its route to its
   next hops.  By this means originator AS has authorized its next hops
   to propagate its own prefix.  And originator AS's next hops would
   also receive this prefix and send it to its next hops.  The
   relationship among them is the signed FC.  That means an FC attests
   that a downstream AS has been selected by the upstream AS that links
   to the downstream AS directly to announce the IP prefix.  The ASes of
   the propagation path of one IP prefix should sign such an FC
   independently.  All the FCs of one IP prefix propagation path could
   detect if there are any route leaks and filter route hijacks.  The
   Forwarding Commitments also tell the ASes in the propagation path
   that the previous hop AS has received and selected this AS_PATH.

   The FC uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488]
   for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   wrapper for the FC content as well as a generic validation procedure
   for RPKI signed objects.  As FCs need to be validated with RPKI
   certificates issued by the current infrastructure, we assume the
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms in [RFC6485] or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the FC (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]),
   this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the FC signed object.
       This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the FC content, which is the payload signed
       by the BGP speaker.  The FC content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an FC beyond the validation steps
       specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The FC Content-Type

   The content-type for an FC is defined as ForwardingCommitment and has
   the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The FC eContent

   The content of an FC identifies a forwarding commitment and
   forwarding binding that an AS announces to other nodes upon receiving
   a BGP-UPDATE message.  Other ASes that are on-path can validate the
   FC and perform path verification for traffic forwarding based on the
   AS-path information.  Off-path ASes can utilize this FC for
   collaborative filtering.  An FC is an instance of
   ForwardingCommitmentAttestation, formally defined by the following
   ASN.1 [X.680] module:

   RPKI-FC-2023
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-rpki-FC-2023(TBD) }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   IMPORTS
     CONTENT-TYPE
     FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- RFC 6268
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) } ;

   id-ct-FC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
       rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) id-smime(16) id-ct(1) fc(TDB) }

   ct-FC CONTENT-TYPE ::=
       { TYPE ForwardingCommitmentAttestation IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-FC }

   ForwardingCommitmentAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {
       version [0]         INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
       originatorASID      ASID,
       prefix              SEQUENCE (SIZE(1)) OF Prefix,
       fc ForwardingCommitment }

   ASID ::= INTEGER (0..4294967295)

   Prefix ::= SEQUENCE {
       afi                 AFI,
       address             IPAddress,
       prefixLength        INTEGER (SIZE(0..128)}

   AFI ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(2))

   IPAddress ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..128))

   ForwardingCommitment ::= SEQUENCE {
       id                  BIT STRING
       signature           BIT STRING }

   END

                   Figure 1: eContent of FC signed object

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).

3.1.  version

   The version number of the ForwardingCommitmentAttestation MUST be 0.

3.2.  originatorASID

   The originatorASID field contains the AS number of the originator AS
   associated with this FC in the BGP-UPDATE message.

3.3.  Type Prefix

   Within the Prefix structure, the prefix field encodes the set of IP
   address prefixes announced by the originator AS in AS_PATH.

3.3.1.  Element afi

   Within the Prefix structure, afi contains the Address Family
   Identifier of an IP address family.  This specification only supports
   IPv4 and IPv6.  Therefore, afi MUST be either 0001 or 0002.

3.3.2.  Element address

   The address field contains the IP address.

3.3.3.  Element prefixLength

   The prefixLength field contains the length of the IP address prefix.

3.4.  Type ForwardingCommitment

   Within the ForwardingCommitment structure, the fc field encodes the
   forwarding commitment generated by this AS and will be validated by
   other AS.

3.4.1.  Element id

   The id field contains the hash of the current AS-path in the
   associated BGP-UPDATE plus the next hop AS and above prefix filed.

3.4.2.  Element signature

   The signature field is a signature signed by the BGP speaker who
   issues this FC.

4.  FC Validation

   Before a relying party can sign a new FC to announce it has trusted
   and selected the routing announcement, the relying party MUST first
   validate the FC object itself.  To validate an FC, the relying party
   MUST perform all the validation checks specified in [RFC6488] as well
   as the following additional FC-specific validation step.

   *  The IP Address Delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
      end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the FC), and the IP
      address prefix in the FC payload is contained within the set of IP
      addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP Address Delegation
      extension.

   *  The EE certificate's IP Address Delegation extension MUST NOT
      contain "inherit" elements described in [RFC3779].

   *  The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension described in
      [RFC3779] is also used in Forwarding Commitment and MUST be
      present in the EE certificate.

5.  FC based BGP AS_PATH Verification

5.1.  FC Generation

   The FC generation procedure follows the BGP-UPDATE.  When one AS
   establishes a connection with its peer, it announces its route to
   peers.  It SHOULD generate FC for each IP prefix in the BGP-UPDATE.
   For example, there are 3 ASes and the topology of them is in a line
   as Figure 2 shows.

   +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
   | AS 65536 | --- | AS 65537 | --- | AS 65538 |
   +----------+     +----------+     +----------+

                    Figure 2: A topology example of 3 AS

   Suppose that the simplified RIB table of AS 65536 is as follows.
   That means there is 1 BGP-UPDATE that is announced from AS 65538 to
   AS 65537 and 1 BGP-UPDATE that is announced from AS 65537 to AS
   65536.  It would generate one FC for prefix 2001:db8:c::/48 when BGP-
   UPDATE is announced from AS 65538 to AS 65537.  But when BGP-UPDATE
   is announced from AS 65537 to AS 65536, it would generate two FCs,
   one for the prefix 2001:db8:c::/48 and one for the prefix
   2001:db8:b::/48.

   Network           Next Hop        Path
   2001:db8:a::/48   ::              i
   2001:db8:b::/48   2001:db8:a::1   65537 i
   2001:db8:c::/48   2001:db8:a::1   65537 65538 i

                 Figure 3: Simplified RIB table of AS 65536

   For BGP-UPDATE announced from AS 65538 to AS 65537, it fills the
   eContent of FC signed object as follows:

   FC_{65538, 65537}:
     version: 0
     orginatorASID: 65538
     prefix:
       afi: 2
       address: 2001:db8:c::
       prefixLength: 48
     ForwardingCommitment:
       id: HASH({65538}, 65537, 2001:db8:c::/48)
       signature: SIGNATURE1

   For BGP-UPDATE announced from AS 65538 to AS 65537, it fills the
   eContent of FC signed objects as follows:

   FC_{65538, 65537, 65536}:
     version: 0
     orginatorASID: 65538
     prefix:
       afi: 2
       address: 2001:db8:c::
       prefixLength: 48
     ForwardingCommitment:
       id: HASH({65538, 65537}, 65536, 2001:db8:c::/48)
       signature: SIGNATURE2

   FC_{65537, 65536}:
     version: 0
     orginatorASID: 65537
     prefix:
       afi: 2
       address: 2001:db8:b::
       prefixLength: 48
     ForwardingCommitment:
       id: HASH({65537}, 65536, 2001:db8:b::/48)
       signature: SIGNATURE3

   These FC signed objects MUST store in the RPKI repository as soon as
   possible after the BGP announcement.

5.2.  FC Verification and AS_PATH Verification

   When one AS receives one BGP-UPDATE, it MUST do as usual: filter the
   BGP route using its local policy, scratch the BGP route to its Route
   Information Base (RIB) table, generate Forwarding Information Base
   (FIB) table, and send it out as per the routing policy.

   When the FC signed objects synchronize from the RPKI repository, the
   BGP speaker MUST find FCs according to the ForwardingCommitment-id:
   HASH(current_AS_PATH, nextHopAS, prefix) in its RIB.  If it finds one
   matched, the BGP speaker verifies the ForwardingCommitment-signature
   in the RPKI repository.

   It SHOULD verify all FCs along the AS_PATH for AS_PATH verification.
   For example, AS 65536 should verify FC_{65538, 65537} and FC_{65538,
   65537, 65536} for prefix 2001:db8:c::/48 in Figure 2.  If all FCs
   checks passed, the AS_PATH would be a valid one.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Route Aggregation

   There is no mechanism in FC that could protect one prefix that has
   been aggregated along the route propagation.

   Maybe a MinLength like MaxLength in ROA could help to mitigate the
   effects of route aggregation.  This field means it permits who to
   aggregate and aggregate to which degree.
